  <h1>Breakpoints</h1>
  <p>In software development, a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for 
    debugging purposes. It is also sometimes simply referred to as a pause. More generally, a breakpoint is a means of 
    acquiring knowledge about a program during its execution. During the interruption, the programmer inspects the test 
    environment (general purpose registers, memory, logs, files, etc.) to find out whether the program is functioning as 
    expected. In practice, a breakpoint consists of one or more conditions that determine when a program's execution should 
    be interrupted.
